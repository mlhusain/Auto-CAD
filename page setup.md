## Mendatory Toolbar on Workspace
Enabling Toolbars

    Open AutoCAD and go to the workspace you are using (like "Architecture").

    Right-click on the toolbar area (where the existing toolbars are located).

    From the context menu, select "Toolbars". A list of available toolbars will appear.

    Check the following toolbars to enable them:
        Draw: Contains drawing tools.
        Modify: Contains editing tools.
        Dimension: For measurement and dimensioning tools.

Arranging Toolbars

    Once the toolbars are enabled, you can click and drag them to your desired location on the screen.

    You can dock them at the top, sides, or keep them floating as per your preference.

Quick Access Toolbar (QAT)

For even quicker access to frequently used tools, consider adding tools to the Quick Access Toolbar (QAT):

    Right-click on a command from any toolbar or the Ribbon.

    Select "Add to Quick Access Toolbar".

Workspace Customization

You can also create a custom workspace that includes your preferred toolbars:

    Go to the "View" tab on the Ribbon.

    In the "Workspace" panel, click on "Save Current As..." to save your customized layout.

    Name your workspace and save it for future use.
